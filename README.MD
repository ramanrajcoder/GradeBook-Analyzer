A Python-based CLI project that allows users to input or import student marks, calculate statistics, assign grades, and generate a complete analysis report.
Features
1. Data Input Options

Manual entry of student names and marks

CSV import (Name, Marks)

2. Statistical Analysis

The program computes:

Average score

Median score

Highest scorer + marks

Lowest scorer + marks

Based on the following scale:

Marks	Grade
90–100	A
80–89	B
70–79	C
60–69	D
below 60	F

4. Grade Distribution

Counts number of students receiving A, B, C, D, F.

5. Pass/Fail Classification

Using list comprehension:

Outputs both lists with student names.
